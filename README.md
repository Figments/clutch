# Clutch

Clutch is a MongoDB ODM inspired by MongooseJS and Rust's very own 
Diesel ORM. Its goal is to provide a means of interfacing with MongoDB 
in an easy to use, intuitive way, without sacrificing the ability to 
perform complex queries.

This project is ostensibly a Work In Progress, and large portions of the 
API are subject to change.
